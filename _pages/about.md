Hello! I am Andrew Chang.

I am a Lead Cloud Security Engineer at [Praetorian](https://www.praetorian.com/). I am focused on **leading penetration tests and configuration reviews against cloud environments and applications** for external clients. As a result of these engagements, I **deliver strategic recommentations to improve the security posture** of my clients' digital infrastructure and assets.

As a security professional, I strongly believe that open collaboration can improve the security of our digital lives. As such, I am enthusiastic about contributing to the cybersecurity community. I leverage my strong track record in **cloud security architecture**, **identity and access management (IAM)**, and **offensive security** to **develop cutting-edge tools and methodologies** to assess cloud and IAM configurations. 

Prior to my time at Praetorian, I was a Security Consulting Engineer at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/) where I also performed offensive security engagements for external clients. I have also completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
