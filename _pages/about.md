Hello! I am Andrew Chang.

I am a Lead Cloud Security Engineer at [Praetorian](https://www.praetorian.com/), focused on **leading penetration tests and configuration reviews against cloud environments and applications** and **delivering strategic recommentations to improve the security posture** of external clients' digital infrastructure and security operations. As a security professional, I strongly believe that open collaboration can improve the security of our digital lives. Consequently, I am enthusiastic about developing cutting-edge tools and methodologies by leveraging my expertise in **cloud security architecture**, **identity and access management (IAM)**, and **offensive security**.

Prior to my time at Praetorian, I was a Security Consulting Engineer at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/) where I also performed offensive security engagements for external clients. I have also completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
